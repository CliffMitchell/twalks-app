Turunc Walks iPhone App

Turun√ß village in south west Turkey is a superb place to walk but visitors face two problems - lack of good quality, detailed maps and lack of documented walks. Our wes site, TuruncWalks.com, aims to address both of these problems and is completely FREE to use:

    We use OpenStreetMap as a source of high quality detailed maps.
    Walks are documented and recorded using accurate GPS devices.
    Walks can be previewed online, downloaded as PDF documents, and downloaded in GPX and KML formats for use on smart phones or with Google Earth.
    Our downloads are compatible with many smart phone apps, many of which are free to download.

TWalks is a companion iPhone app that allows users to take Turunc Walks with them on their iPhone or iPad, follow the route descriptions, and track their
location on Apple Maps against a set of way markers.

The app obtains its data from the web server and stores routes on the device for future use. Routes are updated automatically from the central
server when new versions or new routes become available.
